\section{Introduction to Meta-Reinforcement Learning}

In recent years there has been a growing amount of excitement about 
\textit{meta-learning} in order to solve a wider set of problems. This is 
often used in reinforcement learning tasks. In a standard reinforcement
 learning task, we have a policy that governs how an agent transitions 
between states in an environment. There are rewards that the agent can 
receive, and the optimal policy is one that maximizes rewards. We can 
formalize this by defining a reinforcement learning regime as a Markov 
Decision Process (MDP) where $S$ is the set of states, $A$ is the set 
of actions, $T$ is the transition distribution (how states transition given 
an action), and $R$ is the reward, which is a function of the state. Let 
$\pi_\theta$ be the policy, which is parameterized by some $\theta$. 
Thus for some "task" $\mathcal{T}$, the goal is thus to maximize the objective 
\[ \mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{T}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{a_t \sim \pi_\theta(s_t), s_{t+1}
 \sim T(s_t, a_t)} \left( \sum_t \gamma^t R(s_t, a_{t-1}) \right).\]
The task $\mathcal{T}$ determines the rewards, and hence the policy that is optimized 
depend heavily on what the task $\mathcal{T}$ is. 

Reinforcement learning is used to solve many problems such as Go, Chess, 
Atari games, etc. where the environment is unknown and is structured in 
a way which an agent must discover an optimal strategy. This framework 
gives us a way to view human beings and the nervous system as a 
reinforcement learning program where we humans are the agent. 
(Un)Fortunately, this is a bit too basic of a way of modeling human 
beings and the brain, as reinforcement learning networks have not taken 
over humanity yet (citation needed). One of the reasons is that rewards 
and the task that an agent needs to optimize a policy for is constantly 
changing in the real world. Thus we introduce the idea of meta-learning, 
where rather than optimizing a single policy for a single task $\mathcal{T}$, 
we optimize for a learning strategy on how to optimize a policy for a distribution 
of tasks $p(\mathcal{T})$. This idea is motivated by the idea in psychology of 
 "learning how to learn" and is conceptually closer to how the brain 
works \cite{wang2018pfc}. With meta-learning, due to
the way we are improving the way we are finding the policy, this is a way
we can introduce the idea of "past experiences" to help train policy for 
tasks that are similar.

\section{Multi-Agent Meta-Learning RL to find Optimal Learning Rules}

A very basic way to model a brain is as a simple fixed architecture feedforward neural network 
where each neuron is its own agent and we are optimizing a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem. 
Then, to imitate a model-based dopamine
system which determines which synapses are reinforced, we consider a policy
neural network which will update the weights for the neural net \cite{wang2018pfc, botvinick2019408}. The state space of
this system is essentially the possible weights that this neural net can have. 

From here we construct two different
systems and compare them. One is where a single agent gets information on all of the weights,
and can take actions to improve weights accordingly. This is less biologically plausible since it would be difficult
for any neuron in the brain to have access to have all of this data. The second system we consider is setting one agent
for each layer. Each agent has information about the previous layer's weights and activations, and is able to control
the weights to the next layer. In other words, the agent corresponding to the the $\ell$-th layer, $\*x^{(\ell)}$, has control over the weights 
$[\*W^{(\ell)}]_{ij}$. 

In both systems, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in order to progressively improve the policy. We can define
our reward as the negative loss for the neural network, thus having smaller absolute loss will be a larger reward, and
PPO will find a policy that optimizes for the largest expected reward. To compute the reward for any given policy, we 
take $T$ different trajectories. For each trajectory $t$ we find how the loss $E_t$ 
decreases after a successive forward passes (1e5 epochs) through the neural 
network with weights specified by the agent/policy network. The reward is 
then transmitted as $\langle - E_t \rangle$ and the policy is updated. This process constitutes a single timestep.

Recall from Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) we have update rules that involve using the gradient to traverse through the loss landscape,
in our case we are learning a learning rule and hence the meta "learning how to learn" concept. The goal is for
the policy to converge to a learning rule that is optimal for the given task, which will not necessarily be SGD
or learning with global error signals that we will look at below, but rather one that is more fine-tuned to the particular
set of problems, for example learning from a teacher with noise or classifying digits in the MNIST dataset.

\section{Comparison to Known Learning Rules}

We compare this meta-learning, or learning learning rules, to accepted learning rules in the literature. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges the quickest, but due to the weight transport problem, is not biologically plausible \cite{mazzoni1991}. More biologically plausible alternatives involve learning from a global error signal, and involve perturbation-type learning rules. Global error signals have been observed in the brain, but it is still under much research exactly how the brain uses these error signals in order to learn and update neurons. We will look at node (NP) and weight perturbation (WP). We compare how our new model does for teacher-student learning and learning to classify the MNIST dataset.



The idea behind NP and WP is to take some perturbation $\*\xi$ of either
the weights or the nodes, and then see how that changes the objective or loss. The learning rule update
then corresponds to scaling this perturbation by whether or not it increases or decreases
the loss. Consider a general neural network with $L$ layers and a data set $\{\*x_i^{(0)},\*y_i\}_{i=1}^N$. 
Let $\*W_{\ell} \in \R^{R_{\ell+1} \times R_{\ell}}$ where $R_\ell$ is the number of 
neurons in layer $\ell$. We define the forward pass as
\begin{equation}\label{forward}\*X^{(\ell)} = \sigma\left( \*X^{(\ell-1)}\*W_{\ell-1}^\top\right).\end{equation}
Where $\sigma$ is some non-linearity such as ReLU. We use MSE loss for student teacher
\begin{equation}
\label{mseloss}
E = \frac{1}{NR_L}\frac 12 \| \*X^{(L)}- \*Y\|^2.
\end{equation}
and for classification into $C = R_L$ classes let 
\begin{equation}
\label{crossentropy}
p(\*x_i^{(L)} = r) = \frac{\exp x_{j,r}^{(L)}}{\sum_{j=1}^C \exp x_{i,j}^{(L)}}
\end{equation}
we use cross entropy loss
\[E = -\frac 1N \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{r=1}^C y_r \log p(\*x_i^{(L)} = r) \]
In SGD, we use backpropagation to update the weight parameters by 
\[\Delta_{SGD} \* W_{\ell} = \eta\frac{\partial E}{\partial \*W_{\ell}},\] 
where the chain rule means we 
need to "transport" these values backwards through the neural network. On the other 
hand, in WP/NP, we have two forward passes. For the first, we define the same as \ref{forward}, 
however for NP, we will let the perturbation be a vector $\xi \in \R^{N\times R_{\ell}}$ where all entries are distributed 
i.i.d $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$. We can then define the forward pass as 
\[ \widetilde{\*X}^{(\ell)} = \sigma\left(\widetilde{\*X}^{(\ell-1)}\*W_{\ell -1}^\top + \*\xi^{(\ell)} \right).\]
While for WP we take $\*\Xi^{(\ell)} \in \R^{R_{\ell + 1 }\times R_\ell}$ where all entries are distributed 
i.i.d $\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$. 
\[ \hat{\*X}^{(\ell)} = \sigma\left( \hat{\*X}^{(\ell-1)}\left(\*W_{\ell -1} + \*\Xi^{(\ell-1)}\right)^\top  \right).\]
We can then define two errors for each NP and WP respectively. For MSE
\[ E_N = \frac{1}{NR_L} \frac 12 \| \widetilde{\* X}^{(L)} - \* Y \|^2 \qquad\qquad E_W = \frac{1}{NR_L} \frac 12 \| \hat{\* X}^{(L)} - \* Y \|^2. \]
For classification
\[E_N  =  -\frac 1N \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{r=1}^C y_r \log p(\widetilde{\*x}_i^{(L)} = r) \qquad E_W =  -\frac 1N \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{r=1}^C y_r \log p(\hat{\*x}_i^{(L)} = r)\]
From here we can simply transmit the global error signal $E-E_N$ or $E-E_W$ and update our weights according
to this error signal. In particular, we update parameters as follows for NP
\[ \Delta_{NP} \*W_{\ell} =\frac{\eta}{\sigma} (E-E_N) \sum_{i=1}^{R_{\ell+1}} \*x^{(\ell)}_i \* \xi^{(\ell+1)\top} \]
While for WP we update as
\[ \Delta_{WP} \*W_{\ell} = \frac{\eta}{\sigma} (E-E_W) \* \Xi^{(\ell)} \]
 The idea is that perturbations which cause decrease the objective will be added to 
 the parameters of the model. In expectation we have that up to a constant
\[ \left\langle \Delta_{NP}\*W_{\ell} \right\rangle_{\*\xi^{(\ell)}}= \left\langle \Delta_{WP}\*W_{\ell} \right\rangle_{\*\Xi^{(\ell)}} =  \Delta_{SGD}\*W_{\ell}.\]
Node and weight perturbation are often used in small teacher-student learning cases 
where there is only a single perceptron. Recent work by Hiratani et al. explores node perturbation
in neural networks with a hidden layer, and finds computational and stability issues that
suggest biological implausibility \cite{hiratani2022on}. Nonetheless, these perturbation techniques remain an interesting way
to investigate possible learning rules for neurons.

  \caption{Discuss the results from teacher-student here  \label{fig:teachstudent}}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Training on Student-Teacher (Fig. \ref{fig:teachstudent})} For the student-teacher model, we consider a neural network with one hidden layer. We set the three layer's width as $L_x = 10, L_h = 100, L_y = 10$. We have a teacher with a hidden set of weights $\*W^*_h, \*W^*_y$ that generates a dataset $N=512$ with noise $\*\zeta_i \in \R^{L_y}$ for $i=1,\ldots, N$, where each element of $\*\zeta_i$ is i.i.d $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_t)$. For our cases we set $\sigma_t = 0.01$ as node-perturbation will be very noisy and unstable otherwise. We define our dataset then as $\{\*x_i^{(0)},\*y_i\}_{i=1}^N$ where each element of $\*x_i$ is i.i.d standard normal, and 
\[ \*y_i = \sigma\left(\sigma(\*x_i \*W^{*\top}_h)\*W_y^{*\top}\right) + \*\zeta_i \]
Where we used ReLU as the non-linearity for $\sigma$. We are thus optimizing a single-hidden layer neural network 
\[ \hat{\*y}_i =  \sigma\left(\sigma(\*x_i \*W^{\top}_h)\*W_y^{\top}\right).\]
We are using MSE loss as in \ref{mseloss}.

  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Discuss the results from teacher-student here  \label{fig:mnist}}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Training on MNIST (Fig. \ref{fig:mnist})} Going to MNIST, the problem becomes much more noisy. 
In order to decrease noise, we first preprocess by standardizing and projecting the
data onto the first 10 principal components ($\sim99\%$ of the variance), and decrease the learning rate 
by a factor of 100. It is also necessary to increase the hidden layer width $L_h = 1000$, as otherwise the model did not
have sufficient complexity. We use the same single-hidden layer architecture, with cross entropy loss as in \ref{crossentropy} with $C=10$ for the 10 different digits. As observed by Hiratani et al., the amount of training time required 
for these global error signal models to converge for MNIST is much higher (1e5) which was unfeasible for computationally \cite{hiratani2022on}.
We find the accuracy to be decent (50\%) but clearly not optimized as SGD by itself can reach $80\%$ testing accuracy on 10
principal components. In order to run without weights exploding, we standardized the weights at each step, thereby providing more stability at the cost of expressivity. 

We found that one of the issues in our experiment was the tendency for the learning rule to choose a learning rule that updated the weights according to exactly the optimal weights of a training example, and hence substantial overfitting. This was balanced
by choosing more trajectories for each timestep. Of course, this ended up creating a fairly general learning rule that wasn't able to improve substantially at all. 
\section{Meta-Reinforcement Learning in the Brain}

Wang et al. discussed the 
an notion of "meta-learning" in the brain where the prefrontal cortex acts as a recurrent neural network which triggers actions
and internally holding a notion of the value of a state. Phasic Dopamine (DA) is suggested to act in a similar way to
how our policy network changed the weights of the neural network. In particular, the synaptic weights are adjusted
by the model-free RL DA system, where DA releases are similar to the reward prediction error in temporal-difference RL algorithms.


Basically try and repeat the thing in Box 4 of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661319300610




maybe this is garbage lol

In the Theory of Neural Computation, we can see reinforcement-learning-esque
regimes. In particular researchers have found that the dopamine system seems
to follow the TD algorithm, a reinforcement learning algorithm. In particular, the error
function of the TD algorithm operates in the same way to how dopamine neurons learn their firing rates in order to 
associate stimuli with future rewards. In this case, the dopamine neuron is the agent
and it can change its firing rate as an action. 





\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
following before loading the \verb+neurips_2020+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2020}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
color.

\cite{texbook}
\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\end{table}
\section*{Broader Impact}

Authors are required to include a statement of the broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. 
Authors should discuss both positive and negative outcomes, if any. For instance, authors should discuss a) 
who may benefit from this research, b) who may be put at disadvantage from this research, c) what are the consequences of failure of the system, and d) whether the task/method leverages
biases in the data. If authors believe this is not applicable to them, authors can simply state this.
